# ChurnPrediction
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for subscription-based services (e.g., telecommunications companies) using machine learning techniques. Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue their subscriptions or stop using a service. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can implement proactive retention strategies like targeted incentives or personalized promotions.

Key Features
Data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing customer data

Exploratory data analysis to understand churn patterns and correlations

Multiple machine learning models for churn prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Feature importance analysis to identify key churn indicators

Deployment-ready solution with API endpoints (optional)

Dataset
The project uses a customer churn dataset containing:

Demographic information (age, gender, location)

Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)

Service usage patterns (monthly charges, data usage, add-on services)

Churn status (binary target variable)

Requirements
Python 3.7+

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib/seaborn

Colab
